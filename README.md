# JSONPlaceholder Project

This project is focused on testing the JSONPlaceholder API using Rest Assured and Postman. It includes documentation, code, and test scenarios to facilitate the testing process.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `README.md`: You are currently reading this file, which provides an overview of the project.
- `Word Document`: A word document is included in the project, containing screenshots and explanations of the Rest Assured code and Postman API testing.
- `Postman Collection`: The project includes a Postman collection file, which contains a collection of API requests for testing the JSONPlaceholder API.
- `Excel File`: An Excel file is included, providing test scenarios for the API testing.

## Documentation

The word document included in this project serves as a comprehensive guide for understanding the Rest Assured code and Postman API testing. It includes screenshots and detailed explanations to help you navigate through the testing process effectively.

## Code

The Rest Assured code is an essential part of this project. It allows for automated testing of the JSONPlaceholder API. The code is written using the Rest Assured library in a programming language (such as Java) and provides a foundation for building API tests.

## Postman Collection

The Postman collection file included in this project contains a series of API requests that can be imported into Postman. These requests cover various endpoints and functionalities of the JSONPlaceholder API, allowing for manual testing and exploration of the API's capabilities.

## Test Scenarios

The project also includes an Excel file containing test scenarios. These scenarios outline different test cases and expected results, providing a structured approach to testing the JSONPlaceholder API.
